# dmdCalibration.py

This code is adapted from https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/WFS.net/blob/master/blazing_angle_DMD.ipynb

How to use:
  - insert incident angle alpha (in degrees)
  - check constants for calibration and adjust values if needed
  - run code

The code will tell you:
  - the tilt angles of the DMD
  - information to build the setup correctly (e.g. post heights, distance between posts, ...)
